ðŸ“˜ CGPA Calculator (C++)
Purpose: A console-based C++ program that calculates a student's CGPA based on course grades and credit hours.

User Input: Prompts the user to enter course name, grade, and credit hours for multiple courses.

Calculation Logic:

Computes total grade points as (grade Ã— credit hours) for each course.

Divides total grade points by total credit hours to get the final CGPA.

Error Handling: Prevents division by zero if total credit hours is zero.

Output:

Displays each course's details (name, grade, credit hours).

Prints the final CGPA at the end.

Here's a look about how the code works -

Enter the number of courses taken: 5
Enter course 1 name: Physics
Enter grade for Physics: 8
Enter credit hours for Physics: 3
Enter course 2 name: Mathematics
Enter grade for Mathematics: 9
Enter credit hours for Mathematics: 4
Enter course 3 name: Chemistry
Enter grade for Chemistry: 8
Enter credit hours for Chemistry: 3
Enter course 4 name: Envs
Enter grade for Envs: 9
Enter credit hours for Envs: 3
Enter course 5 name: Python
Enter grade for Python: 8
Enter credit hours for Python: 3

Course Grades:
Physics - Grade: 8, Credit Hours: 3
Mathematics - Grade: 9, Credit Hours: 4
Chemistry - Grade: 8, Credit Hours: 3
Envs - Grade: 9, Credit Hours: 3
Python - Grade: 8, Credit Hours: 3

Final CGPA: 8.4375
